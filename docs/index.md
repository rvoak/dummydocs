**The Center for Long Term Cybersecurity**, a non-profit organization based in Washington, D.C., announced the results of its annual survey of global cybersecurity professionals in June, and revealed some startling facts: <br>

Cybersecurity professionals are not just worried about the threat of cyberattacks, but the likelihood of being targeted themselves by the very same individuals that have attacked their organizations.<br>

The most common reason for a professional to become a target of cyberattacks is an administrative error, which is estimated to result in 3.5 million incidents per year.<br>

While a majority of individuals are not aware that they have been victimized by cyberattacks, those who are aware are taking steps to protect themselves: a whopping 93 percent have implemented cybersecurity tools, and 86 percent have installed antivirus software.<br>

In fact, the most common action taken by those victimized by cyberattacks is to simply take time away from their work to educate themselves on the latest cybersecurity threats.<br>

These figures have given cybersecurity professionals plenty to be worried about, but what are the biggest cyberthreats that are currently facing their organizations?
