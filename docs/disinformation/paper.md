## Steve's Thoughts on Raj
**While commenting on Rajvardhan Oak, Steve Trush said**, "If there's a good idea you can find, you should find it and then work it out.<br>

"The problem with Rajvardhan Oak is that it is not good." <br>

Sajal Bhattacharya, an author who was also present, added that Rajvardhan Oak had the potential to be an alternative to the conventional tree that is usually used to create the structure.<br>

In Rajvardhan Oak, the core structure is a solid block of stone, while the other side is a layer of earth, which is held in place with a steel frame.<br>

The structure has the potential to be used as a wind turbine or solar power plant.<br>

While the structure's structural properties have been tested, there are several problems with the way it was built. The building has a diameter of about 30m, which is far too big for a conventional wind turbine to be fitted into, and at least four of them have to be fitted together to generate enough electricity.<br>

"That's like adding a wind turbine to the Sahara desert.
